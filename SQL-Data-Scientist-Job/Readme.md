# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the Data Scientist job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying Data Scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for Data Scientist?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
-  **Python:** Visualize charts which easy to understand.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Data Scientist job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered Data Scientist positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

Reveiw columns and information from tables first.
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_postings_fact
LIMIT 100;
SELECT * FROM company_dim
LIMIT 100;
```
Answer question 1:
```sql
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here‚Äôs the breakdown of the top data scientist jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range**: The top 10 paying data scientist roles show a significant salary range, spanning from $300,000 to $550,000, highlighting the lucrative potential in the field.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

Reveiw columns and information from other tables, later I can do CTE
```sql
SELECT * FROM skills_dim
LIMIT 100;
SELECT * FROM skills_job_dim
LIMIT 100;
```
Answer question 2:
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
