# Restaurant Ad-Hoc SQL Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is designed to perform ad-hoc analysis on restaurant data using SQL queries based on two key datasets: `menu_items` and `order_details2`. The aim is to gain actionable insights into menu popularity, order patterns, and sales performance through comprehensive SQL data manipulation.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to utilize SQL for in-depth analysis of complex restaurant datasets. By executing structured queries, we uncover critical data points about customer preferences and operational efficiency. This analysis helps in optimizing menu offerings and improving overall business strategies focused on data-driven decisions.

## Data Preparation
### Initializing the Database
Begin by importing the `menu_items` and `order_details2` CSV files into your SQL database to create a robust data foundation ready for querying.

### Understanding the Schema
Post-initialization, the database will feature interconnected tables that mirror real-world restaurant operations, including menu items offered and details of customer orders.

### Data Integrity and Relationships
Primary and foreign keys are established to ensure data integrity and maintain accurate relationships across the restaurant's operational datasets. This structural integrity supports the execution of complex SQL queries.
